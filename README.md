# Digital Optimization

- This repository contains the solutions to the practical exercises (TPs) for digital optimization using MiniZinc.
- MiniZinc is a high-level constraint modeling language that allows you to express and solve combinatorial problems efficiently.
- The solutions provided in this repository serve as examples and references for tackling digital optimization problems. They demonstrate how to formulate problem constraints, define objective functions, and utilize MiniZinc's built-in solvers to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.
